<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Shout out to a sad beginning to duck-hatching season üíö</p>
  </li>
  <li>The importance of living soil; the effects of naturally present bacteria
    <ul>
      <li>Would drying seeds kill off some of the natural bacteria and fungi?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Haskaps - does cultivar fruit size correlate with flavour, especially sweetness?
    <ul>
      <li>Easy to propagate from cuttings</li>
      <li>Despite getting hit with disease and fungi last year, plants are growing and fruiting well this year</li>
      <li>Tend to do better with a compatible pollinator variety</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Growing annuals amongst perennials
    <ul>
      <li>Do you separate your annuals from your perennials in your forest garden?</li>
      <li>Seems many commercial varieties are better suited to conventional organization (ie, rows, no mulch, etc)</li>
      <li>Through a few seasons of selection, oak leaf lettuce seems to do well in summer, and grows amongst perennials in more fungal-dominated soils (2 such anecdotes!)</li>
      <li>Experimenting with naturalizing garlic and onions as the perennials they were meant to be</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Human altruism is powerful
    <ul>
      <li>Seems especially present amongst food forest peeps, and high quality folks like those who are a part of this community</li>
      <li>Building/growing with your community in mind leads to a better social ecosystem for all</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://permapeople.org/plants/senna-hebecarpa-wild-senna">Wild senna</a> is a wild (native to the northeast), perennial, water-loving nitrogen-fixer
    <ul>
      <li>A favourite of some native insects</li>
      <li>Great for rain gardens and wet spots</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In urban environments, woodchip paths can have a wetland effect
    <ul>
      <li>Instead of lawns, which allow permeation, woodchips will absorb and release water over time, mitigating flood and drought events</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Attracting monarchs
    <ul>
      <li>Females will only reproduce if the native milkweed patterns are in ideally shaped clumps</li>
      <li>They‚Äôre attracted to several species of native milkweeds</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Amazing how quickly urban biomes can change; year over year
    <ul>
      <li>Example: When a lawn is left to recoup, the succession will appear to change quickly and drastically over each growing season</li>
      <li>Soils will change (organic matter, pH, etc) quickly</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://permapeople.org/plants/solidago-canadensis-canadian-goldenrod">Goldenrod</a> is a powerful native plant
    <ul>
      <li>Seems to take over if allowed to</li>
      <li>Loved by pollinators</li>
      <li>Medicinal uses</li>
      <li>Great autumn interest</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Managing soil pH
    <ul>
      <li>Soil pH affects which nutrients are available in a given soil</li>
      <li>Irregular or extensive rain events can affect soil pH over time through leaching</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
