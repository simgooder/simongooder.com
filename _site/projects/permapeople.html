            <p>After I left Spotful, I decided to do some upskilling in my downtime. I was playing around the MEAN stack, and wanted to compile some gardening data. I came up with the idea of a plant database, and started building it out, pulling from the Wikipedia API and making it searchable. Doing some research one day, I came across a posting from someone else, who was looking for a partner to build a plant database. I shot him a message, and we’ve been friends ever since.</p>

<p>Some other core members have come and gone, but last year, a new co-founder found us, and has taken over a lot of the development work, giving the original founder some more time.</p>

<p>What started as a plant database, has grown to a living, breathing community — host to over 8500 plants now, and hundreds of regular contributors. They add and edit plants, they swap seeds, they build and share lists. More recently, we’ve been working on a garden designer using P5.js, and working in canvas, which has been something new for me.</p>

<p>Everything we’ve built has been organic and low pressure. We have no agreements in place, we don’t have any required hours, all our growth is 100% organic. It’s been a fun project to really test the limits of the whole <em>if you built it, they will come</em> idea. We’ve built it, and they’ve come. Slowly, but they’re still coming.</p>

<p>Permapeople is an app we built for ourselves. We all use it as our go-to plant search, and gardening designing tool. It’s my true passion project.</p>
