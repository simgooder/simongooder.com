<h4 id="2017-2018">2017-2018</h4>
<p>I contracted on a few design integration projects with The New Business, including the Crew Database and a couple landing pages for the <a href="https://cionorth.ca/">CION</a> website for Northern Ontario‚Äôs Music and Film industry, as well as designing and integrating the <a href="https://northernontario.travel/road-trips/ottawa-mattawa-long-weekend">Northern Ontario Trip Planner</a> (it has since been updated slightly, but the essence, elements, and layout is the same).
I worked within design guidelines to mock up screens, and integrate these designs into HTML and CSS, and prototype any interactions with vanilla JS where necessary. I worked closely with their development team in Basecamp, to ensure handoff was clean and easy.

<p>This project came in through a friendly recommendation (from The New Business). I worked with CI to understand and prototype their vision for an AI-powered chat-bot that could help artists write their own contracts. I worked closely with the founder to develop a high fidelity clickable prototype in Figma over several weeks.
I developed the identity for the project, as well as the general UI and UX, building out a complete component library with documentation, screens, and use-cases for their development team. Unfortunately, the project was dismantled before I was able to see it live!</p>

<h4 id="2020-1">2020</h4>
<p>Another project from a friendly recommendation. As the core designer, I worked with the team at <a href="https://www.cicnews.com">CIC News</a> to develop a fresh identity and a full site design. I designed each component based on the identity, and provided a full component library with documentation, and a workup of every screen in the site to demonstrate the layout. I was contacted for a follow-up project from the CEO at CIC News a year later, but was unable to take on new projects at the time.</p>

<h4 id="april-2021---july-2021">April 2021 - July 2021</h4>
<p>I worked closely with Alyson and Phil, owners at <a href="https://stonetable.co/">Stone Table</a> for 4 months in 2021, working on a number of client projects with them. I helped set up and design component libraries, write documentation, design website and web app screens, and migrate a few projects from Sketch to Figma.
I worked on 4-5 different projects over the course of my work with Stone table, but the one I put a lot of time into was <a href="https://www.edly.co/">Edly</a>. I co-designed the components, website and inner screens with Phil.</p>
