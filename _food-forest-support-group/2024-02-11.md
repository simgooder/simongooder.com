- Plums are easy from seed
    - Cold strat in pits, then crack from seeds to plant in soil
    - Once sprouted, plant out to pots!
- SI planting apples:
    - Tremletts Bitter (Geneva)
    - Porters Perfection
    - Binet Rouge
    - Brown Snout
    - Piel de Sapa Goldrush
    - Texas King Crab (Redbyrd Orchard)
    - Pink Pearl
    - Normanisch
    - Winnals Langdon
- Some folk in QC using wild apples for cider
- Interesting to see how well these wild apples might graft

- Mushrooms!
    - Oysters fruiting with early warm weather (February!)
    - Indoor fruiting of lion’s mane on barley can be successful
    - Wine-cap inoculation of wood chips under fruit trees
        - How to keep these perpetuating?
        - Wine-cap sawdust spawn from North Spore
    - So many factors to fruiting mushrooms!
    - If using hay, you can soak hay in a base solution to purify for oyster inoculation
    - What if you left inoculated logs laying over water? To keep humidity high?
    - If logging trees, inoculating stump would be an efficient way to stack functions

- Chickens!
    - JH Raised Freedom Rangers for meat
    - What about Cornish Cross?
        - “They’re dumb”
    - SI was running Freedom Rangers through an orchard
    - Fermenting chicken feed; 3 day ferment
        - JH had anecdotally heavier birds (20%!) on fermented feed vs. non-fermented feed
        - Ensure feed is soaked, and covered with water for 3 days before feeding
        - SI mentions that there have been experiments where chicken feed in feeders goes further than throwing it on the ground (less is lost)
    - SI is running Freedom Rangers to improve the soil in young food forest aisles
    - JH runs chickens through aisles of young food forest
    - [Brooder plans](https://sowtheland.com/new-products-1/chicken-brooder-plans-f522t)
    - Assumed rooster ratio is 10:1
- Later summer / Fall seeding
    - Will try white plastic tunnels
- Winter seeding with natives; throwing natives on top of the snow
    - Snow / freezing can actually help with germination; moisture and soil contact
- Hot beds!
    - Cold frame on top of a hot compost pile
    - Capturing heat from the decomposition
    - Good for propagation / early seed starting
    - Possible to grow through the winter!
        - Or keep figs + tomatoes alive through the year
    - Needs to be properly insulated;
        - Sawdust or waste wool would work
        - Straw/hay bales would also work
    - A bed of hot manure could be 3’x4’
    - Great for growing out starts to get ready for planting out
    - Idea: What about creating a biochar pit and using the heat from the burn to warm up and jump-start the compost pile?
- Water management
    - Lots of trailering of water for livestock and tree watering
    - Thinking about new water systems to make things more efficient
        - Drip irrigation is efficient
    - [Tree diapers](https://www.treediaper.com/) are an interesting innovation
    - Could using waste wool for mulch help retain/replenish water?
- Wool as mulch; slugs don’t seem to like it
