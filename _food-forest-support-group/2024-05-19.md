- Blueberries need a lot of babying, seem to be a pain in the ass, so we talked about easy to grow blueberry alternatives:
  - [Aronia melanocarpa / chokeberry](https://permapeople.org/plants/aronia-melanocarpa-chokeberry) (especially Viking variety)
  - [Lonicera caerulea / haskap or honeyberry](https://permapeople.org/plants/lonicera-caerulea-haskap)
  - [Amelanchier genus such as Serviceberry or Saskatoon](https://permapeople.org/search?q=amelanchier)
- Creeping Charlie / Ground Ivy ([Glechoma hederacea](https://permapeople.org/plants/glechoma-hederacea-ground-ivy)) seems to be a common lawn herb, but the bees love it
	- It was used in traditional ale recipes by monks, prior to hops, or when hops weren't available
- Speaking of brewing...
	- [The Wildcrafting Brewer](https://www.chelseagreen.com/product/the-wildcrafting-brewer/) by Pascal Baudar is filled with very simple/traditional recipes for brewing various concoctions, like country wines, herbal beers, vinegars, etc
	- [Sacred and Herbal Healing Beers](https://www.brewerspublications.com/products/sacred-herbal-healing-beers-the-secrets-of-ancient-fermentation) by Stephen Harrod Buhner is a compendium of truly traditional herbal beer recipes, as they were brewed hundreds of years ago. Lots of good medicinal use-cases and modernized recipes too
