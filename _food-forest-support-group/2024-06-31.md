## Notes

- Shout out to a sad beginning to duck-hatching season ðŸ’š

- The importance of living soil; the effects of naturally present bacteria
  - Would drying seeds kill off some of the natural bacteria and fungi?

- Haskaps - does cultivar fruit size correlate with flavour, especially sweetness?
  - Easy to propagate from cuttings
  - Despite getting hit with disease and fungi last year, plants are growing and fruiting well this year
  - Tend to do better with a compatible pollinator variety

- Growing annuals amongst perennials
  - Do you separate your annuals from your perennials in your forest garden?
  - Seems many commercial varieties are better suited to conventional organization (ie, rows, no mulch, etc)
  - Through a few seasons of selection, oak leaf lettuce seems to do well in summer, and grows amongst perennials in more fungal-dominated soils (2 such anecdotes!)
  - Experimenting with naturalizing garlic and onions as the perennials they were meant to be

- Human altruism is powerful
  - Seems especially present amongst food forest peeps, and high quality folks like those who are a part of this community
  - Building/growing with your community in mind leads to a better social ecosystem for all

- [Wild senna](https://permapeople.org/plants/senna-hebecarpa-wild-senna) is a wild (native to the northeast), perennial, water-loving nitrogen-fixer
  - A favourite of some native insects
  - Great for rain gardens and wet spots

- In urban environments, woodchip paths can have a wetland effect
  - Instead of lawns, which allow permeation, woodchips will absorb and release water over time, mitigating flood and drought events

- Attracting monarchs
  - Females will only reproduce if the native milkweed patterns are in ideally shaped clumps
  - They're attracted to several species of native milkweeds

- Amazing how quickly urban biomes can change; year over year
  - Example: When a lawn is left to recoup, the succession will appear to change quickly and drastically over each growing season
  - Soils will change (organic matter, pH, etc) quickly

- [Goldenrod](https://permapeople.org/plants/solidago-canadensis-canadian-goldenrod) is a powerful native plant
  - Seems to take over if allowed to
  - Loved by pollinators
  - Medicinal uses
  - Great autumn interest

- Managing soil pH
  - Soil pH affects which nutrients are available in a given soil
  - Irregular or extensive rain events can affect soil pH over time through leaching
