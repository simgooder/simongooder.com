## Notes
### Squash talk
- Cucurbits have a lot of pests
  - [Squash bugs](https://www.almanac.com/pest/squash-bugs) are a pain for folks in the west
  - [Vine borers](https://www.almanac.com/pest/squash-vine-borer) are a pain in the east
    - Back-alley squash surgery can help
    - Suggestion to use a light at night to see where the worms are in the stem, and use a needle for a more nuanced and less destructive approach
- [Fuzzy melon](https://permapeople.org/plants/benincasa-hispida-wax-gourd/chi-qua)'s are awesome
  - A type of gourd, eaten like summer squash
- [Black Beauty zucchini](https://www.westcoastseeds.com/products/black-beauty) do well for folks with a shorter, cooler growing season
- [Dutch White Cucumber](https://www.ecoumene.com/en/produit/semences/potageres/concombre/concombre-de-specialite/concombre-blanc-de-hollande-bio/) does very well in my zone 5b eastern-north-american garden

### Quacks and cluckers
- In cold regions (shout out to [@brightabyss](https://x.com/brightabyss)!) one may need to bring their chickens into the house through extreme winter temperatures
  - Requires constant cleaning
  - Can use large dog kennels for short periods
  - Loud
- Muscovy ducks are great foragers
  - They like to hide their eggs like it's Easter all year round
  - They're big
  - They like to eat amphibians
  - Solid ducks for meat and slug control

### General
- Finding concensus around the importance of a clean and functional watershed should be a priority, but many don't understand nor take it seriously. How do we work together with these types of people?
- Pawpaws can take months (or years) to germinate
  - Some folks experiences pawpaws germinating in August
  - Some had seeds break dormancy the following year, even after cold stratification!
- Making the best of what grows well
  - Sometimes we can't get our favourite foods to grow as easily as we want
  - Some things just grow well (see: green beans), so we should make the best of what we've got
    - [Lacto-fermented green dilly beans recipe](https://www.growforagecookferment.com/lacto-fermented-dilly-beans/#recipe)
    - [Soy-saucse-seared green beans recipe](https://www.jocooks.com/recipes/asian-green-beans/#wprm-recipe-container-50022)
- Wood chips: Do they rob soil of nitrogen?
  - University of Saskatchewan says "NO!" (but kind of yes, too):
    > The nitrogen deficiency does not extend past this very thin layer so it won't impact the roots of plants

### Upcoming
- There were some inquiries about home-grown mushrooms and we talked fungal experiments
  - If anyone has experience growing backyard mushrooms, let's jam on it in a future session!
