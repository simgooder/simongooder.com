- Early blooming for stone fruits this year
- It's lambing season on the west coast
	- Mostly twins
	- 1 set of triplets
	- Using a stanchion to milk the sheep
- West coast: greenhouse growing:
	- Mustards
	- Peas - eaten by rodents
	- Lots of transplants ready
	- Nettles are ready
- Frost-seeding medium red clover in the tree rows
	- Will use hand-powered grass-seeder to seed over mulch
	- A seed-drill would be ideal, but finding out that fits in 12' rows is hard to find
- Blossom-time is too late to prune
- Under-planting vs. grass for fruit trees
	- For harvesting at scale, grass is much more convenient, especially for collecting drops
	- For small-scale, intensive plantings it's a lot more flexible
- Taking a PDC?

	- [PDC at Oregon State](https://workspace.oregonstate.edu/course/permaculture-design-certificate-online)
- Voles! Voles! Voles!
	- Tree guards / tree tubes
	- Does mulching = more voles?
		- Anecdotally, no
	- They seem to like to eat anything young
	- Pawpaws seem to be untouched
- Rooting cuttings
	- Willow roots in-ground with baseball-bat sized branches — easy!
	- Rooting elderberry cuttings: American seems to be easier to root: Can you stick it in the ground?

- Bamboo
	- Grow from rhizome cuttings
	- How can we make it grow taller?
	- Campbell bamboo: 15 to 12' high
		- Used for road screen?
