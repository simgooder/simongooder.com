 I'm a big fan of open an accessible resources, and a proponent of learning traditional skills. I spend a lot of time learning from such a collection of resources for my hobbies, so I had the idea to put it all together in one place.

 I'll likely add to this slowly over time, but ideally, I'll get people to contribute on GitHub or submit more resources through a form. As an amateur woodworker, maker, grower, and bushcrafter, this is exactly the type of resource I take advantage to use myself.
