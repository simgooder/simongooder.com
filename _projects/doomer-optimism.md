Doomer Optimism is the idea that things may be shit, but we if we remain optimistic, we can build a way through it. It's a loose collective of people focused on doing things and making real-world impact. Most are hobbyists with day-jobs, but all focus their free time around family, community, and regenerative pursuits.

I'm one of many revolving hosts on the show, and it gives me an opportunity to interview and talk with fascinating people, I wouldn't otherwise be able to have real, face-to-face discourse with. My topical focus is around rebuilding with existing infrastructure, and growing food.
