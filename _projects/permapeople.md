After I left Spotful, I decided to do some upskilling in my downtime. I was playing around the MEAN stack, and wanted to compile some gardening data. I came up with the idea of a plant database, and started building it out, pulling from the Wikipedia API and making it searchable. Doing some research one day, I came across a posting from someone else, who was looking for a partner to build a plant database. I shot him a message, and we've been friends ever since.

Some other core members have come and gone, but last year, a new co-founder found us, and has taken over a lot of the development work, giving the original founder some more time.

What started as a plant database, has grown to a living, breathing community ‚Äî¬†host to over 8500 plants now, and hundreds of regular contributors. They add and edit plants, they swap seeds, they build and share lists. More recently, we've been working on a garden designer using P5.js, and working in canvas, which has been something new for me.

Everything we've built has been organic and low pressure. We have no agreements in place, we don't have any required hours, all our growth is 100% organic. It's been a fun project to really test the limits of the whole _if you built it, they will come_ idea. We've built it, and they've come. Slowly, but they're still coming.

Permapeople is an app we built for ourselves. We all use it as our go-to plant search, and gardening designing tool. It's my true passion project.
